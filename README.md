# Roll-for-Riches
"Roll the Dice" is an exciting two-player game of chance and strategy. The objective is to score 100 points by rolling a dice and adding up the values. But beware, if you roll a 1, your turn ends and all your accumulated points are lost. Use your strategy to decide when to roll again and when to hold.
